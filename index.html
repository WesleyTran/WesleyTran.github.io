                                    <p>With a year of industry experience, I'm grateful at the opportunities I've had to work in both frontend (Java, HTML, css, Angular) and backend technologies (SQL, C#, .NET, RESTAPI), with exposure to the CI/CD development tools (Unity Version Control, Jenkins, test automation tools) and a beloved Agile work team.</p>
                                    <p>
                                        Early into my engineering career both professionally and leisurely, I've worked with countless people in a world that has a lot of moving pieces- the people, products, designs.
                                        Many times miscommunication happens and slows projects down. I want to be the individual who can bridge this gap for others time and time again with my strong interpersonal skills, allowing me to master my communication skills with people and projects.

                                    <p>
                                        As a team member, I always have my eyes set on empowering and bringing people together in a project as a form of leadership.
                                        This achievement was able to create a closer team bond between the support and development team, allowing for quicker development testing.
                                        It is made evident through my ability to communicate succinctly with people with various levels of technical proficiency and different personality types.
                                        <br />
                                        <br />
                                        Being new to the company and seeing an opportunity, I took initiative and proposed team building activities for all participants to be involved with support from management.
                                        I researched, planned, and trialled different activities such as verbal icebreakers, online virtual activities and card games with each individual member and reflected upon each experience every time.
                                        This required testing designation of agreed allocated time slots for these activities- after long meetings and during start/end of days and required in the inclusion of all without others feeling excluded.
                                        These activities specialised in highlighting communication between different members, spotlighting their individual strengths and strengthened the relationship between the members.
                                        Despite being out of my responsibilities, I was able to take initiative and motivate many engineers through activities, the main
                                        challenge being, working with individuals who were uninterested or had tough schedules.

                                        <br />
                                        My tried and tested solution: shorter games through longer days and longer games after long meetings.
                                        <br />
                                        I was able to master how to effectively empower individuals and consistently highlight and showcase their abilities.

                                    <p>
                                        I am an individual who seeks growth through critique and maintaining accountability for my actions as an aspect of leadership.
                                        Through my experience in testing, I demonstrated a growth mindset, having the ability to accept and follow up my mistakes.
                                        <br />
                                        <br />
                                        Upon my failure to recognise a wrong design element, for a customer to return and provide the feedback- the team did not know who had made the mistake.
                                        Knowing that it was part of my testing, I acknowledged my mistake and apologised, despite feeling embarrassed, alongside providing my needed explanations in my confusion.
                                        After this, I asked for my supervisor's critique of my workflow, correcting my past actions of missing elements and outlining my future actions to be accountable.
                                        I shadowed other testers to learn more thoroughly, I asked questions whenever I was confused through developments and documented the processes for myself and the team.
                                        Moving forward, I was able to test and communicate future design elements, navigating more than 50% faster, whilst communicating with developers to confirm functionality confidently.
                                        <br />
                                        <br />
                                        I was able to improve my actions and follow up with criticism: setting expectations and documenting steps.
                                        Moving forward, the improvements I have made from this leadership experience, was having the ability to be accountable and taking criticism.

                                            Currently, working my experience and building a portfolio of knowledge and material within the industry to later reflect and deconstruct and show to
                                            professionals within the industry. The first short-term step is networking and later using my learning opportunities to expand and assist the
